## 🧠 Overview

Maria, like many users, struggles with generic mental health apps that offer too much content and not enough personalization. MindKit solves this by allowing users to:

- Add their own self-care activities
- Tag activities with moods
- Rate how helpful each activity was
- Get activity suggestions based on mood
- Schedule short, spontaneous activity blocks via their phone’s calendar

This empowers users to build meaningful habits based on what *actually* works for them.
